Open Filza and navigate to /Library/Application Support/LatchKey/Themes

Paste the folder here

Open Settings and go to LatchKey's Preferences

Change Theme to *Spacemask*

Change Position to *Custom*

X Position: 189

Y Position: 520

Scale: 0.58

Tap on Save Values and Respring your device. You should now have the LatchKey theme.

# Wallpaper

This theme works (almost exclusively) in unity with [this](https://i.imgur.com/LfMx1vX.jpg) wallpaper which I have edited to be have a darker background and make use of iPhone X's beautiful OLED display. I do not know who the original creator of the wallpaper is but credits go to them.

When applying the wallpaper, make sure the option is set to Still and not Perspective and that you do not shift the image as that would mess up the settings above.

# Donations

Any donation is much appreciated. I simply ask for ¢50 so that I can pay for tweaks – as my parents don't think I should spend their money on Cydia – but any amount is perfect (even $0). Here's the button in case you wanna help out:
